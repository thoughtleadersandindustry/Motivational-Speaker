### Summary

Robyn argues that to lead a high-performing team, a leader must first enter the world of their people—understanding their fears, motivations, and emotions. Without that connection, commands and directives fall flat. The most effective leaders show humanity, empathy, and humility. She encourages leaders to maintain “double vision”—seeing both from their own perspective **and** from their team’s—in order to build loyalty, trust, and shared commitment.
