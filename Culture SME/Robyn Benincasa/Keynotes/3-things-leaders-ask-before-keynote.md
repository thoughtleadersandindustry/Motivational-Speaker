**Title:** 3 Things Every Leader Should Ask Themselves Before They Book a Keynote Speaker  
**Author:** Robyn Benincasa  
**Published:** August 14 (Year not specified)

### Summary

Robyn argues that booking a keynote speaker should be treated as a strategic move rather than a routine event task. The speaker’s message, tone, and authenticity can echo long after the applause has died. Before selecting a speaker, leaders should reflect on the deeper outcomes they want—the change in culture, mindset, and team behavior—and ensure alignment with their organization’s mission. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
